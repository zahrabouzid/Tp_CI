# TP - CI

## Introduction

Hey! I'm a software developer. I just built the most amazing app but now, I am lost.
I need to make sure that future changes won't break the app.
I am pretty sure that this is the next Facebook or something so make sure that nothing can break it!

This is the link to my GitHub Repository! Feel free to use it as a template.

## What I need
First, I herd about unit testing, I always thought it was a waste of time but now 
I am waiting millions of users so I want to be sure that everything is perfect or you know, I don't want my mom to find a bug that I missed.
No need to write them for 100% of the code, just for the class located at `/app/services/PokemonService.ts`!
I already started writing some things, I hope you'll like it!

## Now the best part
I want to try EVERITHINg because it sounds fun so I want t check at every commit on branches with pul requests and on the main and develop branch:
- the linter sill works
- the tests still pass
- the project build
- the documentation build
- the code has the correct format

## I like to put things in a box
Hey! My friends told me about Docker, it sounds amazing, I want to try it!

I want the most amazing docker image but I want it available so upload it to Docker Hub!
Be sure to make it secure, I don't want a security flaw to destroy my future datacenter!
You only have to push docker images when a commit is pushed on the main branch.


> Do not commit Your Docker Hub API Key, ever, ever, ever! Find another way ;) (If you do, I'll know it)

## Submit your work

The submitting zone will be available as soon as possible (max: 2024-11-26)
